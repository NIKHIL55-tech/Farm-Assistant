# ðŸŒ¾ Multi-Agentic AI for Sustainable Agriculture

A hackathon project aiming to improve farming efficiency and reduce environmental impact using a SQLite-backed multi-agent AI system.

## âœ… Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- SQLite database created and loaded with real datasets
- Agent framework for communication
- Logging setup for traceability

### Phase 2: MVP Agents
- Implemented FarmerAdvisor with farm data analysis and recommendation capabilities
- Built MarketResearcher with price trend analysis and profitability calculations
- Connected agents to database for information retrieval
- Created basic inter-agent communication workflow

## ðŸš€ Agents

- **FarmerAdvisor**: Analyzes farm data and provides crop recommendations based on soil conditions
- **MarketResearcher**: Examines market trends, calculates crop profitability, and forecasts prices

## ðŸ“‚ Usage

```bash
# Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
python database/init_db.py

# Run the phase 2 demo
python test_phase2.py
```

# Agricultural Intelligence Network (AIN): Phased Development Plan

Given your 2-day hackathon timeframe, here's a pragmatic phased development approach that ensures you have a working deliverable at each milestone:

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (4 hours)
**Goal:** Create the foundation that everything else will build upon

1. **Set up SQLite Database**
   - Create basic tables for farms, markets, crops
   - Import your existing datasets
   - Establish simple relationships

2. **Agent Framework Skeleton**
   - Define base agent class with communication methods
   - Create simple message passing between agents
   - Set up logging for debugging

**Deliverable:** Working database with imported data and basic agent framework that can pass messages

## Phase 2: MVP Agents (6 hours)
**Goal:** Implement the two required agents with basic functionality

1. **Farmer Advisor Agent**
   - Implement basic farm data analysis
   - Create simple recommendation logic based on farm characteristics
   - Connect to database for farm information

2. **Market Researcher Agent**
   - Build price trend analysis from your market dataset
   - Implement basic profitability calculations
   - Connect to database for market information

**Deliverable:** Two functioning agents that can provide basic independent recommendations

## Phase 3: Agent Coordination & Decision Engine (6 hours)
**Goal:** Enable agents to work together with basic consensus mechanism

1. **Coordinator Module**
   - Implement weighted recommendation system
   - Create simple algorithm to balance economic and environmental factors
   - Build basic conflict resolution logic

2. **Decision Engine**
   - Develop recommendation aggregation
   - Create simple scoring for sustainability metrics
   - Implement basic visualization of recommendations

**Deliverable:** End-to-end system that provides unified recommendations based on multiple agent inputs

## Phase 4: Enhanced Features & UI (8 hours)
**Goal:** Add differentiating features and user interface

1. **Enhanced Functionality**
   - Implement crop rotation suggestions
   - Add weather data integration (even simulated)
   - Build simple prediction models for yields

2. **Simple Web Interface**
   - Create basic input forms for farm data
   - Build recommendation display dashboards
   - Add simple visualization of environmental impacts

**Deliverable:** User-facing application with advanced recommendations and basic UI

## Phase 5: Polish & Presentation (remainder of time)
**Goal:** Prepare for demo and final submission

1. **Testing & Bug Fixes**
   - Create test cases with sample farms
   - Fix critical bugs
   - Optimize performance bottlenecks

2. **Demo Preparation**
   - Prepare compelling example cases
   - Create brief presentation slides
   - Practice demonstration flow

**Deliverable:** Polished application ready for demonstration

## Contingency Features
If you find yourself ahead of schedule, consider adding these features in order of priority:

1. Simple machine learning for crop yield prediction
2. Interactive scenario comparison tool
3. Visualization of environmental impact metrics
4. Historical recommendation tracking

This phased approach ensures you'll have something functional to present even if you run into unexpected challenges along the way. Each phase builds upon the previous one while delivering a working system.
